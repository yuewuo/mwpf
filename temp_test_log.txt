unit test: primal_module_parallel_circuit_level_noise_qec_playground_2
on MacBook Air, Apple M2, 8-core CPU, 8GB-memory (M-series Macs do not support Hyper-Threading)
Note: I did not really speacify `timeout` here. So perhaps that's what caused the fluctuation in the resolve time
Question/To-be-investigated: use data parallelism techniques inside each serial unit, will this increase or decrease performance?

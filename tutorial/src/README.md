# Introduction

**fusion-blossom** is a fast Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) solver for Quantum Error Correction (QEC).

## Key Features

- **Correctness**: This is an exact MWPM solver, verified against the [Blossom V library](https://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html) with millions of randomized test cases.
- **Linear Complexity**: The decoding time is roughly \\( O(N) \\) given small physical error rate, proportional to the number of defect vertices \\( N \\).
- **Parallelism**: A single MWPM decoding problem can be partitioned and solved in parallel, then *fused* together to find an **exact** global MWPM solution.
- **Simple Interface**: The graph problem is abstracted and optimized for QEC decoders.

## Chapters

For beginners, please read how the MWPM decoder works and how we abstract the MWPM decoder interface in [Problem Definition Chapter](problem_definition.md).

For experts in fusion-blossom, please jump to [Installation](installation.md) or directly go to [demos](demo/example-qec-codes.md).

This library is written in Rust programming language for speed and memory safety, however, we do provide a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/fusion-blossom/) that expose commonly used functions.
Users can install the library using `pip3 install fusion-blossom`.

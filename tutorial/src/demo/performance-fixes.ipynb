    "Found that the cluster priority implementation is not stable with different weights.\n",

    "$$\\mathcal{P}(C) = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{B}_C} y_S - \\sum_{e \\in E_C} \\left( \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{B}_C | e \\in \\delta(S)} y_S \\right) - |\\mathcal{O}_B| - |E_C| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to change a few things:\n",
    "1. change $ - |\\mathcal{O}_B| - |E_C|$ to $/ (|\\mathcal{O}_B| + |E_C|)^3$ because the cardinality doesn't have the same unit\n",
    "2. change $e \\in E_C$ to $e \\in \\mathcal{E}_C$, the local parity factor solution.\n",
    "3. change $\\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{B}_C | e \\in \\delta(S)} y_S$ to $w_e$ because that's how the primal-dual gap defined. Although this is perhaps not very important since the parity factor only uses tight edges $\\mathcal{E}_C \\subseteq T$ and tight edges, by definition, has a dual sum equal to $w_e$.\n",
